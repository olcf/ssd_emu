  The HPC mission includes the Computational Sciences Building, part of the Oak
  Ridge Leadership Computing Facility (OLCF), giving the world's most advanced
  computational researchers an opportunity to tackler problems that would be
  unthinkable on other systems. To date, OLCF has produced three supercomputers,
  each bearing the title "world's fastest computer" in its time. The most recent
  highly efficient pre-exascale system, Summit, reached a speed of 143.5
  petaflops in FY 2018. At its theoretical peak, Summit is capable of 200
  petaflops, eight times more performance than the previously top-ranked HPC
  system, known as Titan. As supercomputing strategy continues to evolve, the
  deign features championed at ORNL will ensure that DOE remains positioned at
  the forefront of HPC on the international stage. Currently, infrastructure is
  being installed to support the next supercomputer, Frontier, which is
  scheduled for operations in FY 2022. The new Summit supercomputer is super in
  more ways than just processing speed, thanks to the help of some engineers
  from F&O's Modernization Project Office who participated on the design team.
  Summit's systems have the ability to utilize moderate water temperature (70째F)
  for cooling. Normally, water for ORNL's supercomputers needs to be chilled to
  45째F. This primary design feature resulted in savings of approximately $3.7
  million in construction costs by eliminating the need for a larger chilled
  water plant. Other construction capital was eliminated by innovations in
  electrical power configuration design for the servers resulting in an
  estimated $500,000 in project savings. And best of all, for long-term
  sustainable operations, Summit is designed to use medium temperature cooling
  water for long-term utility cost savings and improved energy efficiency. Water
  at temperatures of 64-70째F is provided direct to each computer rack. Water
  returns at 85-100째F and is cooled by a tower water heat exchanger, and when
  needed, a chilled water exchanger in series. Bypass of chilled water exchange
  will be possible much of the year. This unique design will result an estimated
  cost reduction of $1 million each year. Facility management is working with
  the High-Performance Computing (HPC) operations staff to optimize cooling
  system by trying computer run scheduler and computer diagnostic system to
  mechanical controls to further reduce operational cost. Now that's SUPER!
